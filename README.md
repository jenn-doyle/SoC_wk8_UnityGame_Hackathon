PLAN:

Dreamer:

new call of duty
subway surfers but with skiers

animated background, characters with effects

Make it BEAUTIFUL

3D rendered characters
cohesive and insightful storyline

award-winning graphics

Realistic:

movable character, static background

photoshop for sprites

simple played catch an object and/or move around objects

input name, timer, points and bonus points

Critic:

Don't go too simple, challenge ourselves with some animation

Tripwire:

use a tutorial as a guide if not able to create the basics for simple game but day 2 mid afternoon

TODO:

Set frame or scene to 50 or a limit so character doesn't move over it.
to get it backdrop

Game should have a score

Is it easy to change the sprites?
